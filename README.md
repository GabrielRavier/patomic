# patomic
This library provides portable access to lock-free atomic operations at runtime
through a unified interface.  
The goal of it is to be used in Python, however there is no reason it can't be 
used in any other language.  
For an overview of the codebase, look at `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Versioning
During development, this project got to version `1.2.0` before I realised that
this is beta software and not stable. The final commit with this old versioning
system is `b9da1c6`. After this, the project version was reset to `0.1.0`.

Until `devel` gets merged into `main`, all breaking changes in `devel` will only
increment the `MINOR` version (the `MAJOR` version will stay at `0`). All releases
based on the `devel` branch will be marked as `pre-release` to signify this.
Once merged with `main`, the version will be incremented to `1.0.0` and obey 
normal semver rules.

## Requirements
This library requires a C90 standards compliant compiler to be compiled. In
addition to this it requires that fundamental integer types not have a trap value
(or at least that a `memcpy` into such a type produces a valid value). This is not 
expected to be an issue, but architectures such as `IA-64` have [posed issues in
the past](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040119-00/?p=41003).

The library will almost compile in freestanding (`assert` and `memcpy` prevent
that), however future implementations (`TSX`) will require `malloc` (although
you could always remove that implementation).
 
A C++14 compiler and a platform supported by GoogleTest is required to compile
and run the tests.  

Although the library will compile with just C90, it will report as no operations
supported unless the requirements for one of the internal implementations is
satisfied. Currently, the following internal implementations have been implemented:
* MSVC (`_Interlocked` & other intrinsics) - supported on every tested version 
  of the compiler (back to VC6)
* C11 (`_Atomic`) - supported if C11 or higher and `__STD_NO_ATOMICS__` isn't defined

and the following implementations are going to be added:
* WIN32 (`Interlocked`)
* GNU (`__atomic` & other intrinsics)
* TSX (`_xbegin()`/`_xend()`)

## Feature Macros
These macros are used to decide which features to use internally. In the
unlikely case that any of the definitions are wrong, they can be overridden. 
They are always defined to be either `0` or `1` (i.e. it is assumed they will 
always be defined, either through internal or command line means).

## Build
This project uses CMake as its build system.  
To build and test on Windows (or with a multi-config generator):
```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -Dpatomic_DEVELOPER_MODE="ON" ..
cmake --build . --config Release
ctest -C Release
```
To build and test on Unix based systems:
```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -Dpatomic_DEVELOPER_MODE="ON" ..
cmake --build .
ctest
```
`patomic_DEVELOPER_MODE` is required to enable testing. Several CMake presets
are also available in `CMakePresets.json`, however these are currently only used
for CI purposes (although they are a good starting point).

### Without CMake
It is possible to compile without CMake although it is slightly more involved.
The `#include`s of `<patomic/patomic_export.h>` and `<patomic/patomic_version.h>`
in `/include/patomic/patomic.h` must be removed, or equivalents must be provided.
These files are generated by CMake and define the following macros:
* `#define PATOMIC_VERSION "X.Y.Z"`
* `#define PATOMIC_VERSION_MAJOR X`
* `#define PATOMIC_VERSION_MINOR Y`
* `#define PATOMIC_VERSION_PATCH Z`

The macro `PATOMIC_EXPORT` is also defined, and its value depends on whether the
library is being built or used. For example, on Windows (MSVC) it might expand to
`__declspec(dllexport)` when the library is being built, and `__declspec(dllimport)`
when the library is being used. For GNU compilers it's always defined to
`__attribute__ ((visibility ("default")))` in both cases.

Once these macros and files are dealt with, something equivalent to the following
`GCC` command can be used:
```shell
$ echo '#define PATOMIC_VERSION "X.Y.Z"
#define PATOMIC_VERSION_MAJOR X
#define PATOMIC_VERSION_MINOR Y
#define PATOMIC_VERSION_PATCH Z' \
  > ./include/patomic/patomic_version.h

$ echo '#define PATOMIC_EXPORT __attribute__ ((visibility ("default")))' \
  > ./include/patomic/patomic_export.h

$ mkdir build && cd build

$ gcc -I../include -I../src/include                      \
      ../src/patomic.c  $(find ../src/impl/ -name "*.c") \
      -fvisibility=hidden -shared -fpic                  \
      -o libpatomic.so

$ rm ../include/patomic/patomic_*.h
```
You should replace the version in this example with actual versions.  
This will not compile the tests.
## Usage
Usage of this library is split into three stages.

### 1. API Call
The types `patomic_t` and `patomic_explicit_t` contain function pointers and
alignment requirements for the operations. Objects of these types can be obtained
through the following two API calls:
```c
patomic_t
patomic_create(
    size_t byte_width,             /* width of atomic object */
    patomic_memory_order_t order,  /* memory order for all operations */
    int options,
    int impl_id_argc,              /* number of variadic parameters */
    ...                            /* implementation ids */
);

patomic_explicit_t
patomic_create_explicit(
    size_t byte_width,  /* width of atomic object */
    int options,
    int impl_id_argc,   /* number of variadic parameters */
    ...                 /* implementation ids */
);
```
Implementation ids can be found in `/include/patomic/types/ids.h` (each implementation
has its own unique ID). Options can be found in `/include/patomic/types/options.h`
and can be combined with `&`. Options do not change the correctness of the program
and are followed by the library on a best faith effort.

### 2. Check Alignment Requirements
The `patomic_t` (or `patomic_explicit_t`) object contains the alignment required
by the operations for the atomic object (in the `.align` member). The first 
requirement is the `recommended` one and it can be checked like this:
```c
#include <stdint.h>

int check_recommended(const volatile void *obj, patomic_t p)
{
    uintptr_t addr = (uintptr_t) obj;
    return (addr % p.align.recommended == 0);
}
```
The second requirement is `minimum`. Checking it is more involved, and it potentially
provides a lower alignment requirement, with the potential downside of a higher
performance penalty. It can be checked like this:
```c
#include <stdint.h>

int check_minimum(const volatile void *obj, patomic_t p, size_t byte_width)
{
    uintptr_t addr = (uintptr_t) obj;
    if (addr % p.align.minimum == 0)
    {
        addr %= p.align.size_within;
        return (addr + byte_width) <= p.align.size_within;
    }
    else { return 0; }
}
```
The reasoning for the two alignment requirements and their purposes can be read
in `/include/patomic/types/align.h`.

### 3. Check Availability
The `.ops` member is a collection of function pointers denoting operations. These
must be checked for `NULL` before they can be used. Once this is done the
operations can be used on the atomic object as shown below:
```c
#include <assert.h>

int atomic_fetch_add(volatile int *obj, int arg, patomic_ops_explicit_t ops)
{
    assert(ops.signed_ops.fp_fetch_add != NULL);
    int result;
    ops.signed_ops.fp_fetch_add(obj, &arg, patomic_SEQ_CST, &result);
    return result;
}
```
A fully written out example is shown further below. The types for all the 
operations can be found in `/include/patomic/types/ops.h`.

In some cases one may want to check if any operations on a given width are 
supported. To that end, the following two API functions are provided:
```c
int
patomic_nonnull_ops_count(
    patomic_ops_t const *const ops
);

int
patomic_nonnull_ops_count_explicit(
    patomic_ops_explicit_t const *const ops
);
```
## Guarantees
The following guarantees are always in place provided the alignment requirements
are followed:
* `recommended` and `minimum` alignment requirements are positive powers of `2`
* `minimum <= recommended`
* all operations available are lock-free (i.e. there is no underlying mutex)
* all operations available are address-free (i.e. they are process safe)
* the memory ordering of the operation is at least as strong as what was requested
* operations do not require any alignment on any `void *` parameters except the 
first one (atomic object)

## Example
The only file you need to include is `patomic/patomic.h`, which works both in C and C++ (although the library still needs to be built as C++).
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include <patomic/patomic.h>

int main()
{
    /* the "atomic" variable */
    volatile int obj = 5;

    /* create explicit struct */
    patomic_explicit_t p;
    p = patomic_create_explicit(
        sizeof obj,               /* byte width */
        patomic_options_DEFAULT,  /* options */
        0                         /* variadic parameter count */
    );

    /* check the alignment of our atomic object */
    uintptr_t addr = (uintptr_t) &obj;
    if (addr % p.align.recommended != 0) {
        printf("Failure: alignment does not meet requirement\n");
        return 1;
    }

    /* check the operation is supported */
    patomic_opsig_explicit_fetch_t fp_fadd_int;
    fp_fadd_int = p.ops.signed_ops.fp_fetch_add;
    if (fp_fadd_int == NULL) {
        printf("Unsupported operation: fetch_add on int\n");
        return 1;
    }

    /* perform addition */
    int arg = 10;
    int old;
    fp_fadd_int(
        &obj,             /* atomic object */
        &arg,             /* input: argument */
        patomic_SEQ_CST,  /* memory order */
        &old              /* output: return value */
    );

    /* final output */
    printf("New value: %d\n", obj);
    printf("Old value: %d\n", old);
    return 0;
}
```
